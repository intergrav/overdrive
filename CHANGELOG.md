Version numbers appear here as "Modpack Version - Tested LC Version". I'll try to test new Lethal Company versions as fast as I can - it's unlikely that there will be issues but there is a small chance that you could have some if playing on an untested LC version.

### 1.2.0 - LC49

- Update CullFactory from 0.8.3 to 0.8.5
- Add FixRPCLag
- Add DissonanceLagFix
- Add information to README

### 1.1.4 - LC49

- Add more information to README
- Shorten description in manifest

### 1.1.3 - LC49

- Shorten description in manifest

### 1.1.2 - LC49

- Fix README consistency

### 1.1.1 - LC49

- Heavily improve README with more information
- Improve icon

### 1.1.0 - LC49

- Remove Frosty's Fastest Company. Doesn't seem to do much and from a rough benchmark I tend to get slightly better framerate without it. May also possibly conflict with other mods in this modpack from a quick look through it's decompiled source code
- Improve README a little bit

### 1.0.1 - LC49

- Increased Cull Factory in-factory cull distance to 60 to make the culling less noticable in the factories
- Show tested Lethal Company version in the manifest description
- Make the icon look better

### 1.0.0 - LC49

- Very open for improvement - create issues/pull requests on the [GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav/overdrive) repository
